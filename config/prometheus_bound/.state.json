  "formattedText": "PROMETHEUS BOUND\r\n\r\nARGUMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, Ouranos and Gaia held sway over Heaven and Earth. And\r\nmanifold children were born unto them, of whom were Cronos, and\r\nOkeanos, and the Titans, and the Giants. But Cronos cast down his\r\nfather Ouranos, and ruled in his stead, until Zeus his son cast him\r\ndown in his turn, and became King of Gods and men. Then were the Titans\r\ndivided, for some had good will unto Cronos, and others unto Zeus;\r\nuntil Prometheus, son of the Titan Iapetos, by wise counsel, gave the\r\nvictory to Zeus. But Zeus held the race of mortal men in scorn, and was\r\nfain to destroy them from the face of the earth; yet Prometheus loved\r\nthem, and gave secretly to them the gift of fire, and arts whereby they\r\ncould prosper upon the earth. Then was Zeus sorely angered with\r\nPrometheus, and bound him upon a mountain, and afterward overwhelmed\r\nhim in an earthquake, and devised other torments against him for many\r\nages; yet could he not slay Prometheus, for he was a God.\r\n\r\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH AND FORCE.\r\nHEPHAESTUS.\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\nCHORUS OF SEA-NYMPHS.\r\nDAUGHTERS OF OCEANUS.\r\nOCEANUS.\r\nIO.\r\nHERMES.\r\n\r\n_Scene—A rocky ravine in the mountains of Scythia_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH.\r\n  Lo, the earth’s bound and limitary land,\r\n  The Scythian steppe, the waste untrod of men!\r\n  Look to it now, Hephaestus—thine it is,\r\n  Thy Sire obeying, this arch-thief to clench\r\n  Against the steep-down precipice of rock,\r\n  With stubborn links of adamantine chain.\r\n  Look thou: thy flower, the gleaming plastic fire,\r\n  He stole and lent to mortal man—a sin\r\n  That gods immortal make him rue to-day,\r\n  Lessoned hereby to own th’ omnipotence\r\n  Of Zeus, and to repent his love to man!\r\n\r\nHEPHAESTUS.\r\n  O Strength and Force, for you the best of Zeus\r\n  Stands all achieved, and nothing bars your will:\r\n  But I—I dare not bind to storm-vext cleft\r\n  One of our race, immortal as are we.\r\n  Yet, none the less, necessity constrains,\r\n  For Zeus, defied, is heavy in revenge!\r\n                                            (_To PROMETHEUS_)\r\n\r\n  O deep-devising child of Themis sage,\r\n  Small will have I to do, or thou to bear,\r\n  What yet we must. Beyond the haunt of man\r\n  Unto this rock, with fetters grimly forged,\r\n  I must transfix and shackle up thy limbs,\r\n  Where thou shalt mark no voice nor human form,\r\n  But, parching in the glow and glare of sun,\r\n  Thy body’s flower shall suffer a sky-change;\r\n  And gladly wilt thou hail the hour when Night\r\n  Shall in her starry robe invest the day,\r\n  Or when the Sun shall melt the morning rime.\r\n  But, day or night, for ever shall the load\r\n  Of wasting agony, that may not pass,\r\n  Wear thee away; for know, the womb of Time\r\n  Hath not conceived a power to set thee free.\r\n  Such meed thou hast, for love toward mankind\r\n  For thou, a god defying wrath of gods,\r\n  Beyond the ordinance didst champion men,\r\n  And for reward shalt keep a sleepless watch,\r\n  Stiff-kneed, erect, nailed to this dismal rock,\r\n  With manifold laments and useless cries\r\n  Against the will inexorable of Zeus.\r\n  Hard is the heart of fresh-usurpèd power!\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH.\r\n  Enough of useless ruth! why tarriest thou?\r\n  Why pitiest one whom all gods wholly hate,\r\n  One who to man gave o’er thy privilege?\r\n\r\nHEPHAESTUS.\r\n  Kinship and friendship wring my heart for him.\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH.\r\n  Ay—but how disregard our Sire’s command?\r\n  Is not thy pity weaker than thy fear?\r\n\r\nHEPHAESTUS.\r\n  Ruthless as ever, brutal to the full!\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH.\r\n  Tears can avail him nothing: strive not thou,\r\n  Nor waste thine efforts thus unaidingly.\r\n\r\nHEPHAESTUS.\r\n  Out on my cursed mastery of steel!\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH.\r\n  Why curse it thus? In sooth that craft of thine\r\n  Standeth assoiled of all that here is wrought.\r\n\r\nHEPHAESTUS.\r\n  Would that some other were endowed therewith!\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH.\r\n  All hath its burden, save the rule of Heaven,\r\n  And freedom is for Zeus, and Zeus alone.\r\n\r\nHEPHAESTUS.\r\n  I know it; I gainsay no word hereof.\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH.\r\n  Up, then, and hasten to do on his bonds,\r\n  Lest Zeus behold thee indolent of will!\r\n\r\nHEPHAESTUS.\r\n  Ah well—behold the armlets ready now!\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH.\r\n  Then cast them round his arms and with sheer strength\r\n  Swing down the hammer, clinch him to the crags.\r\n\r\nHEPHAESTUS.\r\n  Lo, ’tis toward—no weakness in the work!\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH.\r\n  Smite harder, wedge it home—no faltering here!\r\n  He hath a craft can pass th’ impassable!\r\n\r\nHEPHAESTUS.\r\n  This arm is fast, inextricably bound.\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH.\r\n  Then shackle safe the other, that he know\r\n  His utmost craft is weaker far than Zeus.\r\n\r\nHEPHAESTUS.\r\n  He, but none other, can accuse mine art!\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH.\r\n  Now, strong and sheer, drive thro’ from breast to back\r\n  The adamantine wedge’s stubborn fang.\r\n\r\nHEPHAESTUS.\r\n  Alas, Prometheus!  I lament thy pain.\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH.\r\n  Thou, faltering and weeping sore for those\r\n  Whom Zeus abhors! ’ware, lest thou rue thy tears!\r\n\r\nHEPHAESTUS.\r\n  Thou gazest on a scene that poisons sight.\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH.\r\n  I gaze on one who suffers his desert.\r\n  Now between rib and shoulder shackle him—\r\n\r\nHEPHAESTUS.\r\n  Do it I must—hush thy superfluous charge!\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH.\r\n  Urge thee I will—ay, hound thee to the prey.\r\n  Step downward now, enring his legs amain!\r\n\r\nHEPHAESTUS.\r\n  Lo, it is done—’twas but a moment’s toil.\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH.\r\n  Now, strongly strike, drive in the piercing gyves—\r\n  Stern is the power that oversees thy task!\r\n\r\nHEPHAESTUS.\r\n  Brutish thy form, thy speech brutality!\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH.\r\n  Be gentle, an thou wilt, but blame not me\r\n   For this my stubbornness and anger fell!\r\n\r\nHEPHAESTUS.\r\n  Let us go hence; his legs are firmly chained.\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH (_To_ PROMETHEUS).\r\nAha!  there play the insolent, and steal,\r\nFor creatures of a day, the rights of gods!\r\nO deep delusion of the powers that named thee\r\nPrometheus, the Fore-thinker! thou hast need\r\nOf others’ forethought and device, whereby\r\nThou may’st elude this handicraft of ours!\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt HEPHAESTUS, STRENGTH and FORCE.—A pause._]\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  O Sky divine, O Winds of pinions swift,\r\n  O fountain-heads of Rivers, and O thou,\r\n  Illimitable laughter of the Sea!\r\n  O Earth, the Mighty Mother, and thou Sun,\r\n  Whose orbed light surveyeth all—attest,\r\n  What ills I suffer from the gods, a god!\r\n  Behold me, who must here sustain\r\n  The marring agonies of pain,\r\n  Wrestling with torture, doomed to bear\r\n  Eternal ages, year on year!\r\n  Such and so shameful is the chain\r\n  Which Heaven’s new tyrant doth ordain\r\n  To bind me helpless here.\r\n  Woe! for the ruthless present doom!\r\n  Woe! for the Future’s teeming womb!\r\n  On what far dawn, in what dim skies,\r\n  Shall star of my deliverance rise?\r\n\r\n  Truce to this utterance!  to its dimmest verge\r\n  I do foreknow the future, hour by hour,\r\n  Nor can whatever pang may smite me now\r\n  Smite with surprise. The destiny ordained\r\n  I must endure to the best, for well I wot\r\n  That none may challenge with Necessity.\r\n  Yet is it past my patience, to reveal,\r\n  Or to conceal, these issues of my doom.\r\n  Since I to mortals brought prerogatives,\r\n  Unto this durance dismal am I bound:\r\n  Yea, I am he who in a fennel-stalk,\r\n  By stealthy sleight, purveyed the fount of fire,\r\n  The teacher, proven thus, and arch-resource\r\n  Of every art that aideth mortal men.\r\n  Such was my sin:  I earn its recompense,\r\n  Rock-riveted, and chained in height and cold.\r\n\r\n [_A pause._]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Listen! what breath of sound,\r\n  what fragrance soft hath risen\r\n  Upward to me? is it some godlike essence,\r\n  Or being half-divine, or mortal presence?\r\n  Who to the world’s end comes, unto my craggy prison?\r\n  Craves he the sight of pain, or what would he behold?\r\n  Gaze on a god in tortures manifold,\r\n  Heinous to Zeus, and scorned by all\r\n  Whose footsteps tread the heavenly hall,\r\n  Because too deeply, from on high,\r\n  I pitied man’s mortality!\r\n  Hark, and again! that fluttering sound\r\n  Of wings that whirr and circle round,\r\n  And their light rustle thrills the air—\r\n  How all things that unseen draw near\r\n  Are to me Fear!\r\n\r\n Enter the CHORUS OF OCEANIDES in winged cars.\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n  Ah, fear us not! as friends, with rivalry\r\n  Of swiftly-vying wings, we came together\r\n  Unto this rock and thee!\r\n  With our sea-sire we pleaded hard, until\r\n  We won him to our will,\r\n  And swift the wafting breezes bore us hither.\r\n  The heavy hammer’s steely blow\r\n  Thrilled to our ocean-cavern from afar,\r\n  Banished soft shyness from our maiden brow,\r\n  And with unsandalled feet we come, in winged car!\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Ah well-a-day! ye come, ye come\r\n  From the Sea-Mother’s teeming home—\r\n  Children of Tethys and the sire\r\n  Who around Earth rolls, gyre on gyre,\r\n  His sleepless ocean-tide!\r\n  Look on me—shackled with what chain,\r\n  Upon this chasm’s beetling side\r\n  I must my dismal watch sustain!\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n  Yea, I behold, Prometheus! and my fears\r\n  Draw swiftly o’er mine eyes a mist fulfilled of tears,\r\n  When I behold thy frame\r\n  Bound, wasting on the rock, and put to shame\r\n  By adamantine chains!\r\n  The rudder and the rule of Heaven\r\n  Are to strange pilots given:\r\n  Zeus with new laws and strong caprice holds sway,\r\n  Unkings  the ancient Powers, their might constrains,\r\n  And thrusts their pride away!\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Had he but hurled me, far beneath\r\n  The vast and ghostly halls of Death,\r\n  Down to the limitless profound\r\n  Of Tartarus, in fetters bound,\r\n  Fixed by his unrelenting hand!\r\n  So had no man, nor God on high,\r\n  Exulted o’er mine agony—\r\n  But now, a sport to wind and sky,\r\n  Mocked by my foes, I stand!\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n  What God can wear such ruthless heart\r\n  As to delight in ill?\r\n  Who in thy sorrow bears not part?\r\n  Zeus, Zeus alone! for he, with wrathful will,\r\n  Clenched and inflexible,\r\n  Bears down Heaven’s race—nor end shall be, till hate\r\n  His soul shall satiate,\r\n  Or till, by some device, some other hand\r\n  Shall wrest from him his sternly-clasped command!\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Yet,—though in shackles close and strong\r\n  I lie in wasting torments long,—\r\n  Yet the new tyrant, ’neath whose nod\r\n  Cowers down each blest subservient god,\r\n  One day, far hence, my help shall need,\r\n  The destined stratagem to read,\r\n  Whereby, in some yet distant day,\r\n  Zeus shall be reaved of pride and sway:\r\n  And no persuasion’s honied spell\r\n  Shall lure me on, the tale to tell;\r\n  And no stern threat shall make me cower\r\n  And yield the secret to his power,\r\n  Until his purpose be foregone,\r\n  And shackles yield, and he atone\r\n  The deep despite that he hath done!\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n  O strong in hardihood, thou striv’st amain\r\n  Against the stress of pain!\r\n  But yet too free, too resolute thy tongue\r\n  In challenging thy wrong!\r\n  Ah, shuddering dread doth make my spirit quiver,\r\n  And o’er thy fate sits Fear!\r\n  I see not to what shore of safety ever\r\n  Thy bark can steer—\r\n  In depths unreached the will of Zeus doth dwell,\r\n  Hidden, implacable!\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Ay, stern is Zeus, and Justice stands,\r\n  Wrenched to his purpose, in his hands—\r\n  Yet shall he learn, perforce, to know\r\n  A milder mood, when falls the blow—\r\n  His ruthless wrath he shall lay still,\r\n  And he and I with mutual will\r\n  In concord’s bond shall go.\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n  Unveil, say forth to us the tale entire,\r\n  Under what imputation Zeus laid hands\r\n  On thee, to rack thee thus with shameful pangs?\r\n  Tell us—unless the telling pain thee—all!\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Grievous alike are these things for my tongue,\r\n  Grievous for silence—rueful everyway.\r\n  Know that, when first the gods  began  their strife,\r\n  And heaven was all astir with mutual feud—\r\n  Some willing to fling Cronos from his throne,\r\n  And set, forsooth, their Zeus on high as king,\r\n  And other some in contrariety\r\n  Striving to bar him from heaven’s throne for aye—\r\n  Thereon I sought to counsel for the best\r\n  The Titan brood of Ouranos and Earth;\r\n  Yet I prevailed not, for they held in scorn\r\n  My glozing wiles, and, in their hardy pride,\r\n  Deemed that sans effort they could grasp the sway.\r\n  But, for my sake, my mother Themis oft,\r\n  And Earth, one symbol of names manifold,\r\n  Had held me warned, how in futurity\r\n  It stood ordained that not by force or power,\r\n  But by some wile, the victors must prevail.\r\n  In such wise I interpreted; but they\r\n  Deigned not to cast their heed thereon at all.\r\n  Then, of things possible, I deemed it best,\r\n  Joining my mother’s wisdom to mine own,\r\n  To range myself with Zeus, two wills in one.\r\n  Thus, by device of mine, the murky depth\r\n  Of Tartarus enfoldeth Cronos old\r\n  And those who strove beside him. Such the aid\r\n  I gave the lord of heaven—my meed for which\r\n  He paid me thus, a penal recompense!\r\n  For ’tis the inward vice of tyranny,\r\n  To deem of friends as being secret foes.\r\n  Now, to your question—hear me clearly show\r\n  On what imputed fault he tortures me.\r\n  Scarce was he seated on his father’s throne,\r\n  When he began his doles of privilege\r\n  Among the lesser gods, allotting power\r\n  In trim division; while of mortal men\r\n  Nothing he recked, nor of their misery\r\n  Nay, even willed to blast their race entire\r\n  To nothingness, and breed another brood;\r\n  And none but I was found to cross his will.\r\n  I dared it, I alone; I rescued men\r\n  From crushing ruin and th’ abyss of hell—\r\n  Therefore am I constrained in chastisement\r\n  Grievous to bear and piteous to behold,—\r\n  Yea, firm to feel compassion for mankind,\r\n  Myself was held unworthy of the same—\r\n  Ay, beyond pity am I ranged and ruled\r\n  To sufferance—a sight that shames his sway!\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n  A heart of steel, a mould of stone were he,\r\n  Who could complacently behold thy pains\r\n  I came not here as craving for this sight,\r\n  And, seeing it, I stand heart-wrung with pain.\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Yea truly, kindly eyes must pity me!\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n  Say, didst thou push transgression further still?\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Ay, man thro’ me ceased to foreknow his death.\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n  What cure couldst thou discover for this curse?\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Blind hopes I sent to nestle in man’s heart.\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n  This was a goodly gift thou gavest them.\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Yet more I gave them, even the boon of fire.\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n  What? radiant fire, to things ephemeral?\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Yea—many an art too shall they learn thereby!\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n  Then, upon imputation of such guilt,\r\n  Doth Zeus without surcease torment thee thus?\r\n  Is there no limit to thy course of pain?\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  None, till his own will shall decree an end.\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n  And how shall he decree it? say, what hope?\r\n  Seëst thou not thy sin? yet of that sin\r\n  It irks me sore to speak, as thee to hear.\r\n  Nay, no more words hereof; bethink thee now,\r\n  From this ordeal how to find release.\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Easy it is, for one whose foot is set\r\n  Outside the slough of pain, to lesson well\r\n  With admonitions him who lies therein.\r\n  With perfect knowledge did I all I did,\r\n  I willed to sin, and sinned, I own it all—\r\n  I championed men, unto my proper pain.\r\n  Yet scarce I deemed that, in such cruel doom,\r\n  Withering upon this skyey precipice,\r\n  I should inherit lonely mountain crags,\r\n  Here, in a vast tin-neighboured solitude.\r\n  Yet list not to lament my present pains,\r\n  But, stepping from your cars unto the ground,\r\n  Listen, the while I tell the future fates\r\n  Now drawing near, until ye know the whole.\r\n  Grant ye, O grant my prayer, be pitiful\r\n  To one now racked with woe! the doom of pain\r\n  Wanders, but settles, soon or late, on all.\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n  To willing hearts, and schooled to feel,\r\n  Prometheus, came thy tongue’s appeal;\r\n  Therefore we leave, with lightsome tread,\r\n  The flying cars in which we sped—\r\n  We leave the stainless virgin air\r\n  Where winged creatures float and fare,\r\n  And by thy side, on rocky land,\r\n  Thus gently we alight and stand,\r\n  Willing, from end to end, to know\r\n  Thine history of woe.\r\n\r\n The CHORUS alight from their winged cars. Enter OCEANUS mounted on a\r\n griffin.\r\n\r\nOCEANUS.\r\n  Thus, over leagues and leagues of space\r\n  I come, Prometheus, to thy place—\r\n  By will alone, not rein, I guide\r\n  The winged thing on which I ride;\r\n  And much, be sure, I mourn thy case—\r\n  Kinship is Pity’s bond, I trow;\r\n  And, wert thou not akin, I vow\r\n  None other should have more than thou\r\n  Of my compassion’s grace!\r\n  ’Tis said, and shall be proved; no skill\r\n  Have I to gloze and feign goodwill!\r\n  Name but some mode of helpfulness,\r\n  And thou wilt in a trice confess\r\n  That I, Oceanus, am best\r\n  Of all thy friends, and trustiest.\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Ho, what a sight of marvel! what, thou too\r\n  Comest to contemplate my pains, and darest—\r\n  (Yet how, I wot not!) leaving far behind\r\n  The circling tide, thy namefellow, and those\r\n  Rock-arched, self-hollowed caverns—thus to come\r\n  Unto this land, whose womb bears iron ore?\r\n  Art come to see my lot, resent with me\r\n  The ills I bear? Well, gaze thy fill! behold\r\n  Me, friend of Zeus, part-author of his power—\r\n  Mark, in what ruthlessness he bows me down!\r\n\r\nOCEANUS.\r\n  Yea, I behold, Prometheus! and would warn\r\n  Thee, spite of all thy wisdom, for thy weal!\r\n  Learn now thyself to know, and to renew\r\n  A rightful spirit within thee, for, made new\r\n  With pride of place, sits Zeus among the gods!\r\n  Now, if thou choosest to fling forth on him\r\n  Words rough with anger thus and edged with scorn,\r\n  Zeus, though he sit aloof, afar, on high,\r\n  May hear thine utterance, and make thee deem\r\n  His present wrath a mere pretence of pain.\r\n  Banish, poor wretch! the passion of thy soul,\r\n  And seek, instead, acquittance from thy pangs!\r\n  Belike my words seem ancientry to thee—\r\n  Such, natheless, O Prometheus, is the meed\r\n  That doth await the overweening tongue!\r\n  Meek wert thou never, wilt not crouch to pain,\r\n  But, set amid misfortunes, cravest more!\r\n  Now—if thou let thyself be schooled by me—\r\n  Thou must not kick against the goad. Thou knowest,\r\n  A despot rules, harsh, resolute, supreme,\r\n  Whose law is will. Yet shall I go to him,\r\n  With all endeavour to relieve thy plight—\r\n  So thou wilt curb the tempest of thy tongue!\r\n  Surely thou knowest, in thy wisdom deep,\r\n  The saw—_Who vaunts amiss, quick pain is his_.\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  O enviable thou, and unaccused—\r\n  Thou who wast art and part in all I dared!\r\n  And now, let be! make this no care of thine,\r\n  For Zeus is past persuasion—urge him not!\r\n  Look to thyself, lest thine emprise thou rue.\r\n\r\nOCEANUS.\r\n  Thou hast more skill to school thy neighbour’s fault\r\n  Than to amend thine own: ’tis proved and plain,\r\n  By fact, not hearsay, that I read this well.\r\n  Yet am I fixed to go—withhold me not—\r\n  Assured I am, assured, that Zeus will grant\r\n  The boon I crave, the loosening of thy bonds.\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  In part I praise thee, to the end will praise;\r\n  Goodwill thou lackest not, but yet forbear\r\n  Thy further trouble! If thy heart be fain,\r\n  Bethink thee that thy toil avails me not.\r\n  Nay, rest thee well, aloof from danger’s brink!\r\n  I will not ease my woe by base relief\r\n  In knowing others too involved therein.\r\n  Away the thought! for deeply do I rue\r\n  My brother Atlas’ doom. Far off he stands\r\n  In sunset land, and on his shoulder bears\r\n  The pillar’d mountain-mass whose base is earth,\r\n  Whose top is heaven, and its ponderous load\r\n  Too great for any grasp. With pity too\r\n  I saw Earth’s child, the monstrous thing of war,\r\n  That in Cilicia’s hollow places dwelt—\r\n  Typho; I saw his hundred-headed form\r\n  Crushed and constrained; yet once his stride was fierce,\r\n  His jaws gaped horror and their hiss was death,\r\n  And all heaven’s host he challenged to the fray,\r\n  While, as one vowed to storm the power of Zeus,\r\n  Forth from his eyes he shot a demon glare.\r\n  It skilled not: the unsleeping bolt of Zeus,\r\n  The downward levin with its rush of flame,\r\n  Smote on him, and made dumb for evermore\r\n  The clamour of his vaunting: to the heart\r\n  Stricken he lay, and all that mould of strength\r\n  Sank thunder-shattered to a smouldering ash;\r\n  And helpless now and laid in ruin huge\r\n  He lieth by the narrow strait of sea,\r\n  Crushed at the root of Etna’s mountain-pile.\r\n  High on the pinnacles whereof there sits\r\n  Hephaestus, sweltering at the forge; and thence\r\n  On some hereafter day shall burst and stream\r\n  The lava-floods, that shall with ravening fangs\r\n  Gnaw thy smooth lowlands, fertile Sicily!\r\n  Such ire shall Typho from his living grave\r\n  Send seething up, such jets of fiery surge,\r\n  Hot and unslaked, altho’ himself be laid\r\n  In quaking ashes by Zeus’ thunderbolt.\r\n  But thou dost know hereof, nor needest me\r\n  To school thy sense: thou knowest safety’s road—\r\n  Walk then thereon! I to the dregs will drain,\r\n  Till Zeus relent from wrath, my present woe.\r\n\r\nOCEANUS.\r\n  Nay, but, Prometheus, know’st thou not the saw—\r\n  _Words can appease the angry soul’s disease?_\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Ay—if in season one apply their salve,\r\n  Not scorching wrath’s proud flesh with caustic tongue.\r\n\r\nOCEANUS.\r\n  But in wise thought and venturous essay\r\n  Perceivest thou a danger? prithee tell!\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  I see a fool’s good nature, useless toil.\r\n\r\nOCEANUS.\r\n  Let me be sick of that disease; I know,\r\n  Loyalty, masked as folly, wins the way.\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n But of thy blunder I shall bear the blame.\r\n\r\nOCEANUS.\r\n  Clearly, thy word would send me home again.\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Lest thy lament for me should bring thee hate.\r\n\r\nOCEANUS.\r\n  Hate from the newly-throned Omnipotence?\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Be heedful—lest his will be wroth with thee!\r\n\r\nOCEANUS.\r\n  Thy doom, Prometheus, cries to me _Beware!_\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Mount, make away, discretion at thy side!\r\n\r\nOCEANUS.\r\n  Thy word is said to me in act to go:\r\n  For lo, my hippogriff with waving wings\r\n  Fans the smooth course of air, and fain is he\r\n  To rest his limbs within his ocean stall.\r\n\r\n [_Exit OCEANUS._]\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\nFor the woe and the wreck and the doom, Prometheus I utter my sighs;\r\nO’er my cheek flows the fountain of tears from tender, compassionate\r\neyes.\r\nFor stern and abhorred is the sway of Zeus on his self-sought throne,\r\nAnd ruthless the spear of his scorn, to the gods of the days that are\r\ndone.\r\nAnd over the limitless earth goes up a disconsolate cry:\r\n_Ye were all so fair, and have fallen; so great and your might has gone\r\nby!_\r\nSo wails with a mighty lament the voice of the mortals, who dwell\r\nIn the Eastland, the home of the holy, for thee and the fate that\r\nbefel;\r\nAnd they of the Colchian land, the maidens whose arm is for war;\r\nAnd the Scythian bowmen, who roam by the lake of Maeotis afar;\r\nAnd the blossom of battling hordes, that flowers upon Caucasus’ height,\r\nWith clashing of lances that pierce, and with clamour of swords that\r\nsmite.\r\nStrange is thy sorrow! one only I know who has suffered thy pain—\r\nAtlas the Titan, the god, in a ruthless, invincible chain!\r\nHe beareth for ever and ever the burden and poise of the sky,\r\nThe vault of the rolling heaven, and earth re-echoes his cry.\r\nThe depths of the sea are troubled; they mourn from their caverns\r\nprofound,\r\nAnd the darkest and innermost hell moans deep with a sorrowful sound;\r\nAnd the rivers of waters, that flow from the fountains that spring\r\nwithout stain,\r\nAre as one in the great lamentation, and moan for thy piteous pain.\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Deem not that I in pride or wilful scorn\r\n  Restrain my speech; ’tis wistful memory\r\n  That rends my heart, when I behold myself\r\n  Abased to wretchedness. To these new gods\r\n  I and none other gave their lots of power\r\n  In full attainment; no more words hereof\r\n  I speak—the tale ye know. But listen now\r\n  Unto the rede of mortals and their woes,\r\n  And how their childish and unreasoning state\r\n  Was changed by me to consciousness and thought.\r\n  Yet not in blame of mortals will I speak,\r\n  But as in proof of service wrought to them.\r\n  For, in the outset, eyes they had and saw not;\r\n  And ears they had but heard not; age on age,\r\n  Like unsubstantial shapes in vision seen,\r\n  They groped at random in the world of sense,\r\n  Nor knew to link their building, brick with brick,\r\n  Nor how to turn its aspect to the sun,\r\n  Nor how to join the beams by carpentry,\r\n  In hollowed caves they dwelt, as emmets dwell,\r\n  Weak feathers for each blast, in sunless caves.\r\n  Nor had they certain forecast of the cold,\r\n  Nor of the advent of the flowery spring,\r\n  Nor of the fruitful summer. All they wrought,\r\n  Unreasoning they wrought, till I made clear\r\n  The laws of rising stars, and inference dim,\r\n  More hard to learn, of what their setting showed.\r\n  I taught to them withal that art of arts,\r\n  The lore of number, and the written word\r\n  That giveth sense to sound, the tool wherewith\r\n  The gift of memory was wrought in all,\r\n  And so came art and song. I too was first\r\n  To harness ’neath the yoke strong animals,\r\n  Obedient made to collar and to weight,\r\n  That they might bear whate’er of heaviest toil\r\n  Mortals endured before. For chariots too\r\n  I trained, and docile service of the rein,\r\n  Steeds, the delight of wealth and pomp and pride.\r\n  I too, none other, for seafarers wrought\r\n  Their ocean-roaming canvas-wingèd cars.\r\n  Such arts of craft did I, unhappy I,\r\n  Contrive for mortals: now, no feint I have\r\n  Whereby I may elude my present woe.\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n  A rueful doom is thine! distraught of soul,\r\n  And all astray, and like some sorry leech\r\n  Art thou, repining at thine own disease,\r\n  Unskilled, unknowing of the needful cure.\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  More wilt thou wonder when the rest thou hearest—\r\n  What arts for them, what methods I devised.\r\n  Foremost was this: if any man fell sick,\r\n  No aiding art he knew, no saving food,\r\n  No curing oil nor draught, but all in lack\r\n  Of remedies they dwindled, till I taught\r\n  The medicinal blending of soft drugs,\r\n  Whereby they ward each sickness from their side.\r\n  I ranged for them the methods manifold\r\n  Of the diviner’s art; I first discerned\r\n  Which of night’s visions hold a truth for day,\r\n  I read for them the lore of mystic sounds,\r\n  Inscrutable before; the omens seen\r\n  Which bless or ban a journey, and the flight\r\n  Of crook-clawed birds, did I make clear to man—\r\n  And how they soar upon the right, for weal,\r\n  How, on the left, for evil; how they dwell,\r\n  Each in its kind, and what their loves and hates,\r\n  And which can flock and roost in harmony.\r\n  From me, men learned what deep significance\r\n  Lay in the smoothness of the entrails set\r\n  For sacrifice, and which, of various hues,\r\n  Showed them a gift accepted of the gods;\r\n  They learned what streaked and varied comeliness\r\n  Of gall and liver told; I led them, too,\r\n  (By passing thro’ the flame the thigh-bones, wrapt\r\n  In rolls of fat, and th’ undivided chine),\r\n  Unto the mystic and perplexing lore\r\n  Of omens; and I cleared unto their eyes\r\n  The forecasts, dim and indistinct before,\r\n  Shown in the flickering aspect of a flame.\r\n  Of these, enough is said.

Worst of woes\r\n  Are words that break their promise to our hope!\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n  Woe! woe! avaunt—thou and thy tale of bane!\r\n    O never, never dared I dream\r\n  Such horror of strange sounds should pierce mine ear;\r\n  Such loathly sights, such tortures hard to bear,\r\n  Outrage, pollution, agony supreme,\r\n  Wasting my heart with double edge of pain!\r\n  Ah Fate, ah Fate!

Long it were to tell\r\n  In clear succession all that thence shall be.\r\n  Take this for sooth—in lineage from her\r\n  A hero shall arise, an archer great,\r\n  And he shall be my saviour from these woes.\r\n  Such knowledge of the future Themis gave,\r\n  The ancient Titaness, to me her son.\r\n  But how, and by what skill, ’twere long to say,\r\n  And no whit will the knowledge profit thee.\r\n\r\nIO.\r\n  O woe, O rending and convulsive pain,\r\n  Frenzy and agony, again, again\r\n      Searing my heart and brain!\r\n  O dagger of the sting, unforged with fire\r\n  Yet burning, burning ever!  O my heart,\r\n  Pulsing with horror, beating at my breast!\r\n  O rolling maddened eyes! away, apart,\r\n      Raving with anguish dire,\r\n  I spring, by frenzy-fiends possest.\r\n  O wild and whirling words, that sweep in gloom\r\n      Down to dark waves of doom!\r\n\r\n [_Exit IO._]\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n  O well and sagely was it said—\r\n    Yea, wise of heart was he who first\r\n    Gave forth in speech the thought he nursed—\r\n  _In thine own order see thou wed!_\r\n\r\n  Let not the humble heart aspire\r\n    To the gross home of wealth and pride;\r\n    Nor be it to a hearth allied\r\n  That vaunts of many a noble sire.\r\n\r\n  O Fates, of awful empery!\r\n    Never may I by Zeus be wooed—\r\n    Never give o’er my maidenhood\r\n  To any god that dwells on high.\r\n\r\n  A shudder to my soul is sent,\r\n    Beholding Io’s doom forlorn—\r\n    By Hera’s malice put to scorn,\r\n  Roaming in mateless banishment.\r\n\r\n  From wedlock’s crown of fair desire\r\n    I would not shrink—an idle fear!\r\n    But may no god to me draw near\r\n  With shunless might and glance of fire!\r\n\r\n  That were a strife wherein no chance\r\n    Of conquest lies: from Zeus most high\r\n    And his resolve, no subtlety\r\n  Could win me my deliverance.\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  And yet shall Zeus, for all his stubborn pride,\r\n  Be brought to low estate! aha, he schemes\r\n  Such wedlock as shall bring his doom on him,\r\n  Flung from his kingship to oblivion’s lap!\r\n  Ay, then the curse his father Cronos spake\r\n  As he fell helpless from his agelong throne,\r\n  Shall be fulfilled unto the utterance!\r\n  No god but I can manifest to him\r\n  A rescue from such ruin as impends—\r\n  I know it, I, and how it may be foiled.\r\n  Go to, then, let him sit and blindly trust\r\n  His skyey rumblings, for security,\r\n  And wave his levin with its blast of flame!\r\n  All will avail him not, nor bar his fall\r\n  Down to dishonour vile, intolerable\r\n  So strong a wrestler is he moulding now\r\n  To his own proper downfall—yea, a shape\r\n  Portentous and unconquerably huge,\r\n  Who truly shall reveal a flame more strong\r\n  Than is the lightning, and a crash of sound\r\n  More loud than thunder, and shall dash to nought\r\n  Poseidon’s trident-spear, the ocean-bane\r\n  That makes the firm earth quiver.  Let Zeus strike\r\n  Once on this rock, he speedily shall learn\r\n  How far the fall from power to slavery!\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n  Beware! thy wish doth challenge Zeus himself.\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  I voice my wish and its fulfilment too.\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n  What, dare we look for one to conquer Zeus?\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Ay—Zeus shall wear more painful bonds than mine\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n  Darest thou speak such taunts and tremble not?\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Why should I fear, who am immortal too?\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n  Yet he might doom thee to worse agony.\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Out on his dooming! I foreknow it all.\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n  Yet do the wise revere Necessity.\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Ay, ay—do reverence, cringe and crouch to power\r\n  Whene’er, where’er thou see it! But, for me,\r\n  I reck of Zeus as something less than nought.\r\n  Let him put forth his power, attest his sway,\r\n  Howe’er he will—a momentary show,\r\n  A little brief authority in heaven!\r\n  Aha, I see out yonder one who comes,\r\n  A bidden courier, truckling at Zeus’ nod,\r\n  A lacquey in his new lord’s livery,\r\n  Surely on some fantastic errand sped!\r\n\r\n Enter HERMES.\r\n\r\nHERMES.\r\n  Thou, double-dyed in gall of bitterness,\r\n  Trickster and sinner against gods, by giving\r\n  The stolen fire to perishable men!\r\n  Attend—the Sire supreme doth bid thee tell\r\n  What is the wedlock which thou vauntest now,\r\n  Whereby he falleth from supremacy?\r\n  Speak forth the whole, make all thine utterance clear,\r\n  Have done with words inscrutable, nor cause\r\n  To me, Prometheus! any further toil\r\n  Or twofold journeying. Go to—thou seest\r\n  Zeus doth not soften at such words as thine!\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Pompous, in sooth, thy word, and swoln with pride,\r\n  As doth befit the lacquey of thy lords!\r\n  O ye young gods! how, in your youthful sway,\r\n  Ye deem secure your citadels of sky,\r\n  Beyond the reach of sorrow or of fall!\r\n  Have I not seen two dynasties of gods\r\n  Already flung therefrom? and soon shall see\r\n  A third, that now in tyranny exults,\r\n  Shamed, ruined, in an hour! What sayest thou?\r\n  Crouch I and tremble at these stripling powers?\r\n  Small homage unto such from me, or none!\r\n  Betake thee hence, sweat back along thy road—\r\n  Look for no answer from me, get thee gone!\r\n\r\nHERMES.\r\n  Think—it was such audacities of will\r\n  That drove thee erst to anchorage in woe!\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Ay—but mark this: mine heritage of pain\r\n  I would not barter for thy servitude.\r\n\r\nHERMES.\r\n  Better, forsooth, be bond-slave to a crag,\r\n  Than true-born herald unto Zeus the Sire!\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Take thine own coin—taunts for a taunting slave!\r\n\r\nHERMES.\r\n  Proud art thou in thy circumstance, methinks!\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Proud? in such pride then be my foemen set,\r\n  And I to see—and of such foes art thou!\r\n\r\nHERMES.\r\n  What, blam’st thou me too for thy sufferings?\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Mark a plain word—I loathe all gods that are,\r\n  Who reaped my kindness and repay with wrong.\r\n\r\nHERMES.\r\n  I hear no little madness in thy words.\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Madness be mine, if scorn of foes be mad.\r\n\r\nHERMES.\r\n  Past bearing were thy pride, in happiness.\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Ah me!\r\n\r\nHERMES.\r\n  Zeus knoweth nought of sorrow’s cry!\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  He shall! Time’s lapse bringeth all lessons home.\r\n\r\nHERMES.\r\n  To thee it brings not yet discretion’s curb.\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  No—else I had not wrangled with a slave!\r\n\r\nHERMES.\r\n  Then thou concealest all that Zeus would learn?\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  As though I owed him aught and should repay!\r\n\r\nHERMES.\r\n  Scornful thy word, as though I were a child—\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Child, ay—or whatsoe’er hath less of brain—\r\n  Thou, deeming thou canst wring my secret out!\r\n  No mangling torture, no, nor sleight of power\r\n  There is, by which he shall compel my speech,\r\n  Until these shaming bonds be loosed from me.\r\n  So, let him fling his blazing levin-bolt!\r\n  Let him with white and winged flakes of snow,\r\n  And rumbling earthquakes, whelm and shake the world!\r\n  For nought of this shall bend me to reveal\r\n  The power ordained to hurl him from his throne.\r\n\r\nHERMES.\r\n  Bethink thee if such words can mend thy lot.\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  All have I long foreseen, and all resolved.\r\n\r\nHERMES.\r\n  Perverse of will! constrain, constrain thy soul\r\n  To think more wisely in the grasp of doom!\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Truce to vain words! as wisely wouldst thou strive\r\n  To warn a swelling wave: imagine not\r\n  That ever I before thy lord’s resolve\r\n  Will shrink in womanish terror, and entreat,\r\n  As with soft suppliance of female hands,\r\n  The Power I scorn unto the utterance,\r\n  To loose me from the chains that bind me here—\r\n  A world’s division ’twixt that thought and me!\r\n\r\nHERMES.\r\n  So, I shall speak, whate’er I speak, in vain!\r\n  No prayer can melt or soften thy resolve;\r\n  But, as a colt new-harnessed champs the bit,\r\n  Thou strivest and art restive to the rein.\r\n  But all too feeble is the stratagem\r\n  In which thou art so confident: for know\r\n  That strong self-will is weak and less than nought\r\n  In one more proud than wise. Bethink thee now—\r\n  If these my words thou shouldest disregard—\r\n  What storm, what might as of a great third wave\r\n  Shall dash thy doom upon thee, past escape!\r\n  First shall the Sire, with thunder and the flame\r\n  Of lightning, rend the crags of this ravine,\r\n  And in the shattered mass o’erwhelm thy form,\r\n  Immured and morticed in a clasping rock.\r\n  Thence, after age on age of durance done,\r\n  Back to the daylight shall thou come, and there\r\n  The eagle-hound of Zeus, red-ravening, fell\r\n  With greed, shall tatter piecemeal all thy flesh\r\n  To shreds and ragged vestiges of form—\r\n  Yea, an unbidden guest, a day-long bane,\r\n  That feeds, and feeds—yea, he shall gorge his fill\r\n  On blackened fragments, from thy vitals gnawed.\r\n  Look for no respite from that agony\r\n  Until some other deity be found,\r\n  Ready to bear for thee the brunt of doom,\r\n  Choosing to pass into the lampless world\r\n  Of Hades and the murky depths of hell.\r\n  Hereat, advise thee! ’tis no feigned threat\r\n  Whereof I warn thee, but an o’er-true tale.\r\n  The lips of Zeus know nought of lying speech,\r\n  But wreak in action all their words foretell.\r\n  Therefore do thou look warily, and deem\r\n  Prudence a better saviour than self-will.\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n  Meseems that Hermes speaketh not amiss,\r\n  Bidding thee leave thy wilfulness and seek\r\n  The wary walking of a counselled mind.\r\n  Give heed! to err through anger shames the wise.\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  All, all I knew, whate’er his tongue\r\n  In idle arrogance hath flung.\r\n  ’Tis the world’s way, the common lot—\r\n  Foe tortures foe and pities not.\r\n  Therefore I challenge him to dash\r\n  His bolt on me, his zigzag flash\r\n    Of piercing, rending flame!\r\n  Now be the welkin stirred amain\r\n  With thunder-peal and hurricane,\r\n  And let the wild winds now displace\r\n  From its firm poise and rooted base\r\n    The stubborn earthly frame!\r\n  The raging sea with stormy surge\r\n  Rise up and ravin and submerge\r\n    Each high star-trodden way!\r\n  Me let him lift and dash to gloom\r\n  Of nether hell, in whirls of doom!\r\n  Yet—do he what extremes he may—\r\n  He cannot crush my life away!\r\n\r\nHERMES.\r\n  Such are the counsels, such the strain,\r\n  Heard from wild lips and frenzied brain!\r\n  In word or thought, how fails his fate\r\n  Of madness wild and desperate?\r\n                                          (_To the_ CHORUS)\r\n  But ye, who stand compassionate\r\n  Here at his side, depart in haste!\r\n  Lest of his penalty ye taste,\r\n  And shattered brain and reason feel\r\n  The roaring, ruthless thunder-peal!\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n  Out on thee! if thy heart be fain\r\n  I should obey thee, change thy strain!\r\n  Vile is thine hinted cowardice,\r\n  And loathed of me thy base advice,\r\n    Weakly to shrink from pain!\r\n  Nay, at his side, whate’er befall,\r\n  I will abide, endure it all!\r\n  Among all things abhorr’d, accurst,\r\n  I hold betrayers for the worst!\r\n\r\nHERMES.\r\n  Nay, ye are warned! remember well—\r\n  Nor cry, when meshed in nets of hell,\r\n  _Ah cruel fate, ah Zeus unkind—\r\n  Thus, by a sentence undivined,\r\n  To dash us to the realms below!_\r\n  It is no sudden, secret blow—\r\n  Nay, ye achieve your proper woe—\r\n  Warn’d and foreknowing shall ye go,\r\n  Through your own folly trapped and ta’en,\r\n  Into the net the Fates ordain—\r\n  The vast, illimitable pain!\r\n\r\n [_Thunder and lightning._]\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n  Hark! for no more in empty word,\r\n  But in sheer sooth, the world is stirred!\r\n  The massy earth doth heave and sway,\r\n  And thro’ their dark and secret way\r\n    The cavern’d thunders boom!\r\n  See, how they gleam athwart the sky,\r\n    The lightnings, through the gloom!\r\n  And whirlwinds roll the dust on high,\r\n  And right and left the storm-clouds leap\r\n  To battle in the skyey deep,\r\n  In wildest uproar unconfined,\r\n  An universe of warring wind!\r\n  And falling sky and heaving sea\r\n  Are blent in one! on me, on me,\r\n  Nearer and ever yet more near,\r\n  Flaunting its pageantry of fear,\r\n  Drives down in might its destined road\r\n  The tempest of the wrath of God!\r\n  O holy Earth, O mother mine!\r\n  O Sky, that biddest speed along\r\n  Thy vault the common Light divine,—\r\n    Be witness of my wrong!\r\n\r\n [_The rocks are rent with fire and earthquake, and fall, burying\r\n PROMETHEUS in the ruins._]"

Hi team,

I wanted to follow up on our discussion with Sarah Chen regarding the Acme Corporation contract review. We've identified several key areas that need attention before our December 15th deadline.

The intellectual property licensing section requires significant revision, particularly around the confidentiality provisions. Michael Rodriguez from our outside counsel has provided some excellent feedback on strengthening these clauses.

Additionally, we need to verify the property details for the facility at 1247 Oak Street, Palo Alto. The lease agreement references this address multiple times, but we still need to confirm the identity of the owner before proceeding with the transfer documentation.

We should schedule a call this week to discuss the due diligence findings and ensure we're aligned on the path forward. The client is expecting our revised draft by end of week.

Let me know your availability for Thursday afternoon.

Best regards,
Jennifer Walsh
Senior Legal Counsel

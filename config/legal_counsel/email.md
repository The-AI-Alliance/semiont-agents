Hi Jennifer,

Following up on our call yesterday regarding the Acme Corporation contract review and the December 15th deadline, I’ve summarized my recommendations below and attached the latest redline.

## Intellectual Property Licensing (Section 4):

I revised Section 4.2 (Scope of License) to clarify that Acme receives a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license solely for internal business purposes.

In Section 4.3 (Sublicensing), I’ve added language requiring your prior written consent before Acme can grant any sublicenses to third parties.

I also inserted a new Section 4.6 (Residuals) to address the parties’ rights to use residual know-how, which should help avoid disputes over generalized learning by your technical teams.

## Confidentiality Provisions (Section 7):

I tightened the definition of “Confidential Information” to expressly include source code, technical documentation, customer data, and due diligence materials.

The survival period has been extended from three (3) years to five (5) years following termination, which is more consistent with market practice given the sensitivity of the IP involved.

I added an explicit reference to your information security standards, by incorporating “Exhibit C – Information Security Requirements” by reference. This gives you flexibility to update those requirements without fully amending the agreement.

## Property Details – 1247 Oak Street, Palo Alto:

Our preliminary review of county records indicates that 1247 Oak Street, Palo Alto, CA 94301 is currently held in the name of Oak Street Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.

The existing lease appears to be between Oak Street Holdings LLC (as “Landlord”) and Acme Corporation (as “Tenant”), with a term through June 30, 2029 and two three-year renewal options.

I recommend we request (a) a landlord estoppel certificate confirming the lease is in full force and effect and (b) a certificate of good standing for Oak Street Holdings LLC, to attach as exhibits to the transfer documentation.

## Due Diligence Items and Next Steps:

We should confirm whether any subleases or shared-use arrangements exist for the Oak Street facility; if so, those agreements should be listed in Schedule 2.1(b) of the transaction documents.

Please have your team verify whether Acme has made any material capital improvements at the site since January 1, 2023; if yes, we may want to address reimbursement or ownership of those improvements in the closing documentation.

Once you and Sarah have reviewed the redlines, I suggest we hold a 30-minute call on Thursday afternoon to finalize the revisions before sending the revised draft to the client by week’s end.

Let me know if Thursday at 3:00 PM PT works for you and Sarah. If that time is not convenient, I can also make 4:30 PM PT work.

Best regards,
Michael
